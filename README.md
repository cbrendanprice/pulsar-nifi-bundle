# Apache NiFi - Processor for Apache Pulsar

## How to build

This processor allows you to define the versions of the Apache NiFi and Apache Pulsar libraries that you that you want to use inside the processor, along with the JDK version you want to compile the classes with. 

To build the NAR files using Maven, just run the following command. 

`mvn clean package -Denforcer.skip`

This will also generate a Docker image inside your local docker daemon with the tag `streamnative/nifi`

*Note: Currently, this command will load NAR files that were build using the default NiFi, Pulsar, and Java versions
into the lib folder of the NiFi container for testing. Therefore, if you need to test artifacts built using a
different version of these libraries, then you will first need to copy those NAR artifacts into the docker/lib folder *BEFORE* building
the Docker image.

## How to test

A Dockerfile has been included in the project that can be used to test the Processor locally, and can be started with the following command:

`docker run --name nifi -d -p 8443:8443 
-e SINGLE_USER_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME=admin 
-e SINGLE_USER_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD=ctsBtRBKHRAx69EqUghvvgEvjnaLjFEB 
streamnative/nifi`

See the [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/nifi) on the base image for more configuration options

Visit https://localhost:8443/nifi/login and enter the username and password you provided in the docker command.

## How to debug

The JVM Debugger can be enabled by setting the environment variable NIFI_JVM_DEBUGGER to any value when running the docker image, e.g.

`docker run --name nifi \
-p 8443:8443 -p 8000:8000 \
-d \
-e NIFI_JVM_DEBUGGER=true
streamnative/nifi`
